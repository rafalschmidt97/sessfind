# Search Modes

sessfind supports four search modes. Use `Shift+Tab` in the TUI to cycle between them, or pass `--method` in the CLI.

## FTS — Full-Text Search

The default mode. Powered by [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) with BM25 ranking.

![sessfind Full-Text Search mode](../assets/tui-fts.webp)

```
shopping                single keyword
shopping assistant      all words required (AND), any order
shopping OR assistant   any word may match
+shopping +assistant    explicit all-words form
"shopping assistant"    exact phrase
shopp*                  prefix wildcard
```

!!! tip
    FTS is fast and works well for most queries. Use it when you remember specific keywords from a session.

## Fuzzy Search

Case-insensitive substring match across content, project name, and title. Good for short, approximate queries.

![sessfind Fuzzy search mode](../assets/tui-fuzzy.webp)

```bash
sessfind search "auth" --method fuzzy
```

## LLM Search

Agentic search using your installed AI CLI tools (Claude Code, OpenCode, Copilot). Each detected tool appears as a separate mode in the TUI: `LLM (claude)`, `LLM (opencode)`, etc.

**How it works:**

1. You type a natural language query (e.g., "that conversation about fixing CI")
2. Press `Enter` to trigger the search
3. The LLM analyzes your intent and generates optimized FTS queries (synonyms, related terms, multi-language)
4. sessfind executes each generated query and merges the results

!!! info "Auto-detection"
    No extra installation needed. If you have `claude`, `opencode`, or `copilot` on your `PATH`, the LLM mode appears automatically. The LLM is invoked in headless mode (e.g., `claude -p`).

!!! tip "Multi-provider"
    Each detected AI tool becomes its own search mode. You can try the same query with different LLM backends.

## Semantic Search

ML embedding similarity search. Finds conceptually similar sessions even when exact keywords don't match.

- Requires the [`sessfind-semantic`](../plugins/semantic-search.md) plugin
- Supports Polish and English (and 100+ languages via multilingual-e5-small)
- Press `Enter` to trigger (not instant — runs the ML model)

```bash
sessfind search "database connection pooling" --method semantic
```

!!! warning
    Semantic search is slower than FTS or fuzzy because it runs a local ML model. The first run downloads the model (~450MB).
