# Interactive TUI

## Launching the TUI

```bash
sessfind            # launch TUI
sessfind --index    # index all sources first, then launch TUI
sessfind --index-in-background  # launch now and refresh while using the TUI
```

Background indexing starts a separate process, so it can finish after the TUI
closes. The status bar shows progress and reloads the session list when indexing
finishes while the TUI is open.

## Pane Layout

The TUI opens in full-screen mode with three areas:

- **Left pane** — search results list (source, project, date)
- **Right pane** — session details and conversation preview
- **Bottom** — search input with mode indicator

## Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| *Type / Backspace / Delete* | Filter sessions after a one-second pause in editing |
| `Tab` | Switch focus between search and results |
| `Shift+Tab` | Toggle search mode (FTS / Fuzzy / LLM / Semantic*) |
| `Ctrl+S` | Toggle sort order (Newest first / Best match) |
| `Up/Down`, `j/k` | Navigate results |
| `Enter` | Resume selected session (opens confirmation dialog) |
| `PgUp/PgDn` | Scroll session preview by one page |
| `r` | Re-index the selected session's source (preview pane) |
| `Ctrl+U` | Clear search input |
| `F1` | Show help popup |
| `Esc` | Cancel a pending search, close help, or quit |

!!! note
    `Semantic` mode is only available when the [`sessfind-semantic`](../plugins/semantic-search.md) plugin is installed.

## Sort Order

Press `Ctrl+S` (while in search focus) to toggle the sort order of results:

| Sort Mode | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Newest first** *(default)* | Sessions sorted by time descending, then by relevance score |
| **Best match** | Sessions sorted by relevance score descending, then by time |

The current sort order is displayed at the bottom of the results list. The setting persists until the application is closed — switching between search and results does not reset it.

## Resume Confirmation

When you press `Enter` on a selected session, a confirmation dialog appears showing:

- **Session summary** — source, date (in local time), and title
- **Directory choice** — where to resume the session:
    - **Session directory** — the original project directory (if it no longer exists, it will be created)
    - **Current directory** — your current working directory
    - **Cancel** — go back to search

Use `↑/↓` to select an option and `Enter` to confirm, or `Esc` to cancel.

All dates in the TUI are displayed in your computer's local timezone.

Search failures are shown separately from an empty result set and keep the
previous successful results visible. The status bar and preview also warn when
a source is stale or failed; press `r` in the preview pane to retry that source.

Full-text and fuzzy searches wait until input has been unchanged for one second,
so typing, cursor movement, and held Backspace remain responsive. Press `Enter`
to run a pending search immediately. Semantic and LLM searches remain
Enter-triggered.
